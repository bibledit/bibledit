\c 3
\d A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased!
\q2 Many are those who rise up against me.
\q1
\v 2 Many there are who say of my soul,
\q2 “There is no help for him in God.”\f + \fr 3:2 \ft The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).\f* \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,
\q2 my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
\q1
\v 4 I cry to Yahweh with my voice,
\q2 and he answers me out of his holy hill. \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 5 I laid myself down and slept.
\q2 I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.
\q1
\v 6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people
\q2 who have set themselves against me on every side.
\q1
\v 7 Arise, Yahweh!
\q2 Save me, my God!
\q1 For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone.
\q2 You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
\q1
\v 8 Salvation belongs to Yahweh.
\q2 May your blessing be on your people. \qs Selah.\qs*
