\c 13
\q1
\v 1 He that touches pitch will be defiled;
\q1 And he that has fellowship with a proud man will become like to him.
\q1
\v 2 Take not up a burden above your strength;
\q1 And have no fellowship with one that is mightier and richer than yourself.
\q1 What fellowship shall the earthen pot have with the kettle?
\q1 This will strike, and that will be dashed in pieces.
\q1
\v 3 The rich man does a wrong, and he threatens withal:
\q1 The poor is wronged, and he will entreat withal.
\q1
\v 4 If you be profitable, he will make merchandise of you;
\q1 And if you be in lack, he will forsake you.
\q1
\v 5 If you have substance, he will live with you;
\q1 And he will make you bare, and will not be sorry.
\q1
\v 6 Does he need of you? then he will deceive you,
\q1 And smile upon you, and give you hope:
\q1 He will speak you fair, and say, What need you?
\q1
\v 7 And he will shame you by his meats,
\q1 Until he have made you bare twice or thrice,
\q1 And at the last he will laugh you to scorn:
\q1 Afterward he will see you, and will forsake you,
\q1 And shake his head at you.
\q1
\v 8 Beware that you be not deceived, and brought low in your mirth.
\q1
\v 9 If a mighty man invites you, be retiring,
\q1 And he will invite you so much the more.
\q1
\v 10 Press not upon him, lest you be thrust back;
\q1 And stand not far off, lest you be forgotten.
\q1
\v 11 Do not try to speak with him as an equal,
\q1 And believe not his many words:
\q1 For he will test you with much talk,
\q1 And will search you out in a smiling manner.
\q1
\v 12 He that doesn’t keep spoken words to himself is unmerciful;
\q1 And he will not spare to hurt and to bind.
\q1
\v 13 Keep \add them \add* to yourself, and take earnest heed,
\q1 For you walk \f + \fr 13:13 \ft Gr. \fqa along with. \f* in peril of your falling.
\v 14 \f + \fr 13:14 \ft The remainder of verse 13, and verse 14, are omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1
\v 15 Every living creature loves his like,
\q1 And every man \add loves \add* his neighbor.
\q1
\v 16 All flesh consorts according to kind,
\q1 And a man will cleave to his like.
\q1
\v 17 What fellowship shall the wolf have with the lamb?
\q1 So \add is \add* the sinner to the godly.
\q1
\v 18 What peace is there between the hyena and the dog?
\q1 And what peace between the rich man and the poor?
\q1
\v 19 Wild asses are the prey of lions in the wilderness;
\q1 So poor men are pasture for the rich.
\q1
\v 20 Lowliness is an abomination to a proud man;
\q1 So a poor man is an abomination to the rich.
\b
\q1
\v 21 A rich man when he is shaken is held up of his friends;
\q1 But one of low degree being down is thrust away also by his friends.
\q1
\v 22 When a rich man is fallen, there are many helpers;
\q1 He speaks \f + \fr 13:22 \ft Or, \fqa secrets, and \f* things not to be spoken, and men justify him:
\q1 A man of low degree falls, and men rebuke him withal;
\q1 He utters wisdom, and no place is allowed him.
\q1
\v 23 A rich man speaks, and all keep silence;
\q1 And what he says they extol to the clouds:
\q1 A poor man speaks, and they say, Who is this?
\q1 And if he stumble, they will help to overthrow him.
\b
\q1
\v 24 Riches are good that have no sin;
\q1 And poverty is evil in the mouth of the ungodly.
\q1
\v 25 The heart of a man changes his countenance,
\q1 Whether it be for good or for evil. \f + \fr 13:25 \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1
\v 26 A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity;
\q1 And the finding out of parables is a weariness of thinking.
