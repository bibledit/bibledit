\c 10
\q1
\v 1 A wise judge will instruct his people;
\q1 And the government of a man of understanding will be well ordered.
\q1
\v 2 As is the judge of his people, so are his ministers;
\q1 And as is the ruler of the city, \add such are \add* all those who dwell therein.
\q1
\v 3 An uninstructed king will destroy his people;
\q1 And a city will be established through the understanding of the powerful.
\q1
\v 4 In the hand of the Lord is the authority of the earth;
\q1 And in due time he will raise up over it one that is profitable.
\q1
\v 5 In the hand of the Lord is the prosperity of a man;
\q1 And he will lay his honor upon the person of the scribe.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Be not angry with your neighbor for every wrong;
\q1 And do nothing by works of violence.
\q1
\v 7 Pride is hateful before the Lord and \add before \add* men;
\q1 And in the judgement of both will unrighteousness err.
\q1
\v 8 Sovereignty is transferred from nation to nation,
\q1 Because of iniquities, and deeds of violence, and greed of money.
\q1
\v 9 \f + \fr 10:9 \ft The text here is uncertain. \f* Why is earth and ashes proud?\f + \fr 10:9 \ft Two lines of this verse are here omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1 Because in \add his \add* life he has cast away his bowels.
\q1
\v 10 \add It is \add* a long disease; the physician mocks:
\q1 And \add he is \add* a king today, and tomorrow he will die.
\q1
\v 11 For when a man is dead,
\q1 He will inherit creeping things, and beasts, and worms.
\q1
\v 12 \add It is \add* the beginning of pride when a man departs from the Lord;
\q1 And his heart is departed from him that made him.
\q1
\v 13 For the beginning of pride is sin;
\q1 And he that keeps it will pour forth abomination.
\q1 For this cause the Lord brought upon them strange calamities,
\q1 And overthrew them utterly.
\q1
\v 14 The Lord cast down the thrones of rulers,
\q1 And set the meek in their stead.
\q1
\v 15 The Lord plucked up the roots of nations,
\q1 And planted the lowly in their stead.
\q1
\v 16 The Lord overthrew the lands of nations,
\q1 And destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.
\q1
\v 17 He took some of them away, and destroyed them,
\q1 And made their memorial to cease from the earth.
\q1
\v 18 Pride has not been created for men,
\q1 Nor wrathful anger for the offspring of women.
\b
\q1
\v 19 \f + \fr 10:19 \ft The MSS. here greatly differ. The rendering represents the most probable text.\f* What manner of seed has honor? the seed of man.
\q1 What manner of seed has honor? those who fear the Lord.
\q1 What manner of seed has no honor? the seed of man.
\q1 What manner of seed has no honor? those who transgress the commandments.
\q1
\v 20 In the midst of kindred he that rules them has honor;
\q1 And in the eyes of the Lord those who fear him.
\v 21 \f + \fr 10:21 \ft Verse 21 is omitted by the best authorities.\f*
\q1
\v 22 The rich man, and the honorable, and the poor,
\q1 Their glorying is the fear of the Lord.
\q1
\v 23 It is not right to dishonor a poor man that has understanding;
\q1 And it is not fitting to glorify a man that is a sinner.
\q1
\v 24 The great man, and the judge, and the mighty man, will be glorified;
\q1 And there is not one of them greater than he that fears the Lord.
\q1
\v 25 Free men will minister to a wise servant;
\q1 And a man that has knowledge will not murmur \add thereat. \add*
\b
\q1
\v 26 Be not over wise in doing your work;
\q1 And glorify not yourself in the time of your distress.
\q1
\v 27 \f + \fr 10:27 \ft The Greek text of this verse is uncertain.\f* Better is he that labors, and abounds in all things,
\q1 Than he that glorifies himself, and lacks bread.
\q1
\v 28 My son, glorify your soul in meekness,
\q1 And give it honor according to the worthiness thereof.
\q1
\v 29 Who will justify him that sins against his own soul?
\q1 And who will glorify him that dishonors his own life?
\b
\q1
\v 30 A poor man is glorified for his knowledge;
\q1 And a rich man is glorified for his riches.
\q1
\v 31 But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in riches?
\q1 And he that is inglorious in riches, how much more in poverty?
\b
