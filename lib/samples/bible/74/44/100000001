\v 5 Such as sought out musical tunes,
\q1 And set forth verses in writing:
\q1
\v 6 Rich men furnished with ability,
\q1 Living peaceably in their habitations:
\q1
\v 7 All these were honored in their generations,
\q1 And were a glory in their days.
\q1
\v 8 There be of them, that have left a name behind them,
\q1 To declare their praises.
\q1
\v 9 And some there be, which have no memorial;
\q1 Who are perished as though they had not been,
\q1 And are become as though they had not been born;
\q1 And their children after them.
\q1
\v 10 But these were men of mercy,
\q1 Whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten.
\q1
\v 11 With their seed shall remain continually a good inheritance;
\q1 Their children \add are \add* \f + \fr 44:11 \ft Or, \fqa In their testaments\f* within the covenants.

\v 13 Their seed shall remain forever,
\q1 And their glory shall not be blotted out.
\q1
\v 14 Their bodies were buried in peace,
\q1 And their name lives to all generations.

\q1 And the congregation tells out their praise.

\q1 \add Being \add* an example of repentance to all generations.
\q1
\v 17 Noah was found perfect \add and \add* righteous;
\q1 In the season of wrath he was taken in exchange \add for the world;\add*
\q1 Therefore was there left a remnant to the earth,
\q1 When the flood came.
\q1
\v 18 Everlasting covenants were made with him,
\q1 That all flesh should no more be blotted out by a flood.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Abraham was a great father of a multitude of nations;
\q1 And there was none found like him in glory;
\q1
\v 20 Who kept the law of the Most High,
\q1 And was taken into covenant with him:
\q1 In his flesh he established the covenant;
\q1 And when he was proved, he was found faithful.
\b
\q1
\v 21 Therefore he assured him by an oath,
\q1 That the nations should be blessed in his seed;
\q1 That he would multiply him as the dust of the earth,
\q1 And exalt his seed as the stars,
\q1 And cause them to inherit from sea to sea,
\q1 And from the River to the utmost part of the earth.
\q1
\v 22 In Isaac also did he establish likewise, for Abraham his father’s sake,
\q1 The blessing of all men, and the covenant:
\q1
\v 23 And he made it rest upon the head of Jacob;
\q1 He acknowledged him in his blessings,
\q1 And gave to him by inheritance,
\q1 And divided his portions;
\q1 Among twelve tribes did he part them.
