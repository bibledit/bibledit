\c 120
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q1
\v 1 In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.
\q2 He answered me.
\q1
\v 2 Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips,
\q2 from a deceitful tongue.
\q1
\v 3 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,
\q2 you deceitful tongue?
\q1
\v 4 Sharp arrows of the mighty,
\q2 with coals of juniper.
\q1
\v 5 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech,
\q2 that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
\q1
\v 6 My soul has had her dwelling too long
\q2 with him who hates peace.
\q1
\v 7 I am for peace,
\q2 but when I speak, they are for war.
