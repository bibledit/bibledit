\c 127
\d A Song of Ascents. By Solomon.
\q1
\v 1 Unless Yahweh builds the house,
\q2 they who build it labor in vain.
\q1 Unless Yahweh watches over the city,
\q2 the watchman guards it in vain.
\q1
\v 2 It is vain for you to rise up early,
\q2 to stay up late,
\q2 eating the bread of toil,
\q2 for he gives sleep to his loved ones.
\q1
\v 3 Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.
\q2 The fruit of the womb is his reward.
\q1
\v 4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
\q2 so are the children of youth.
\q1
\v 5 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.
\q2 They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
