\c 133
\d A Song of Ascents. By David.
\q1
\v 1 See how good and how pleasant it is
\q2 for brothers to live together in unity!
\q1
\v 2 It is like the precious oil on the head,
\q2 that ran down on the beard,
\q2 even Aaron’s beard,
\q2 that came down on the edge of his robes,
\q1
\v 3 like the dew of Hermon,
\q2 that comes down on the hills of Zion;
\q2 for there Yahweh gives the blessing,
\q2 even life forever more.
