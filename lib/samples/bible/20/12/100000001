\q1
\v 15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
\q2 but he who is wise listens to counsel.
\q1
\v 16 A fool shows his annoyance the same day,
\q2 but one who overlooks an insult is prudent.
\q1
\v 17 He who is truthful testifies honestly,
\q2 but a false witness lies.
\q1
\v 18 There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,
\q2 but the tongue of the wise heals.

\q2 but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness.

\q2 but laziness ends in slave labor.

\q2 but the way of the wicked leads them astray.
