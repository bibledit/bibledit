\c 131
\d A Song of Ascents. By David.
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, my heart isn’t arrogant, nor my eyes lofty;
\q2 nor do I concern myself with great matters,
\q2 or things too wonderful for me.
\q1
\v 2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,
\q2 like a weaned child with his mother,
\q2 like a weaned child is my soul within me.
\q1
\v 3 Israel, hope in Yahweh,
\q2 from this time forward and forever more.
