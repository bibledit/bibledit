\c 1
\cp 151
\d This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though extra,\f + \fr 1:0\ft or, supernumerary\f* composed when he fought in single combat with Goliath.
\q1
\v 1 I was small among my brothers,
\q2 and youngest in my father’s house.
\q2 I tended my father’s sheep.
\q1
\v 2 My hands formed a musical instrument,
\q2 and my fingers tuned a lute.
\q1
\v 3 Who shall tell my Lord?
\q2 The Lord himself, he himself hears.
\q1
\v 4 He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep,
\q2 and he anointed me with his anointing oil.
\q1
\v 5 My brothers were handsome and tall;
\q2 but the Lord didn’t take pleasure in them.
\q1
\v 6 I went out to meet the Philistine,
\q2 and he cursed me by his idols.
\q1
\v 7 But I drew his own sword and beheaded him,
\q2 and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
