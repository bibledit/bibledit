\v 4 Behold, even our cities and those who dwell in them are your servants. Come and deal with them as it is good in your eyes.”

\v 7 They received him, they and all the country round about them, with garlands and dances and timbrels.
\v 8 He cast down all their borders, and cut down their sacred groves. It had been given to him to destroy all the gods of the land, that all the nations would worship Nebuchadnezzar only, and that all their tongues and their tribes would call upon him as god.

\v 10 He encamped between Geba and Scythopolis. He was there a whole month, that he might gather together all the baggage of his army.
