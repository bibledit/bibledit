\c 142
\d A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer.
\q1
\v 1 I cry with my voice to Yahweh.
\q2 With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.
\q1
\v 2 I pour out my complaint before him.
\q2 I tell him my troubles.
\q1
\v 3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
\q2 you knew my route.
\q1 On the path in which I walk,
\q2 they have hidden a snare for me.
\q1
\v 4 Look on my right, and see;
\q2 for there is no one who is concerned for me.
\q2 Refuge has fled from me.
\q2 No one cares for my soul.
\q1
\v 5 I cried to you, Yahweh.
\q2 I said, “You are my refuge,
\q2 my portion in the land of the living.”
\q1
\v 6 Listen to my cry,
\q2 for I am in desperate need.
\q1 Deliver me from my persecutors,
\q2 for they are too strong for me.
\q1
\v 7 Bring my soul out of prison,
\q2 that I may give thanks to your name.
\q1 The righteous will surround me,
\q2 for you will be good to me.
