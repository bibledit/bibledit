\c 124
\d A Song of Ascents. By David.
\q1
\v 1 If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,
\q2 let Israel now say,
\q1
\v 2 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side,
\q2 when men rose up against us;
\q1
\v 3 then they would have swallowed us up alive,
\q2 when their wrath was kindled against us;
\q1
\v 4 then the waters would have overwhelmed us,
\q2 the stream would have gone over our soul;
\q1
\v 5 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
\q1
\v 6 Blessed be Yahweh,
\q2 who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
\q1
\v 7 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.
\q2 The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
\q1
\v 8 Our help is in Yahweh’s name,
\q2 who made heaven and earth.
