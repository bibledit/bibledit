\c 26
\d By David.
\q1
\v 1 Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity.
\q2 I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.
\q1
\v 2 Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me.
\q2 Try my heart and my mind.
\q1
\v 3 For your loving kindness is before my eyes.
\q2 I have walked in your truth.
\q1
\v 4 I have not sat with deceitful men,
\q2 neither will I go in with hypocrites.
\q1
\v 5 I hate the assembly of evildoers,
\q2 and will not sit with the wicked.
\q1
\v 6 I will wash my hands in innocence,
\q2 so I will go about your altar, Yahweh,
\q2
\v 7 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard
\q2 and tell of all your wondrous deeds.
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house,
\q2 the place where your glory dwells.
\q1
\v 9 Don’t gather my soul with sinners,
\q2 nor my life with bloodthirsty men;
\q2
\v 10 in whose hands is wickedness,
\q2 their right hand is full of bribes.
\b
\q1
\v 11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.
\q2 Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
\q1
\v 12 My foot stands in an even place.
\q2 In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.
