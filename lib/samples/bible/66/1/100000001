\v 9 I John, your brother and partner with you in the oppression, Kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the isle that is called Patmos because of God’s Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
\v 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like a trumpet
\v 11 saying, \f + \fr 1:11 \ft TR adds “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last.”\f*\wj “What you see, write in a book and send to the seven assemblies:\wj*\f + \fr 1:11 \ft TR adds “which are in Asia”\f*\wj to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.”\wj*

\v 12 I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having turned, I saw seven golden lamp stands.
\v 13 And among the lamp stands was one like a son of man,\x + \xo 1:13\xt Daniel 7:13 \x* clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.
\v 14 His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.
\v 15 His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.
\v 16 He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.
\v 17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.
\p He laid his right hand on me, saying, \wj “Don’t be afraid. I am the first and the last,\wj*
\v 18 \wj and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.\wj*\f + \fr 1:18 \ft or, Hell\f*
\v 19 \wj Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter. \wj*
\v 20 \wj The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands is this: The seven stars are the angels\wj*\f + \fr 1:20 \ft or, messengers (here and wherever angels are mentioned)\f* \wj of the seven assemblies. The seven lamp stands are seven assemblies.\wj*
