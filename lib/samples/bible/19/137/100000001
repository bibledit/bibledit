\c 137
\q1
\v 1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.
\q2 Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
\q1
\v 2 On the willows in that land,
\q2 we hung up our harps.
\q1
\v 3 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.
\q2 Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:
\q2 “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
\q1
\v 4 How can we sing Yahweh’s song in a foreign land?
\q1
\v 5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,
\q2 let my right hand forget its skill.
\q1
\v 6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don’t remember you,
\q2 if I don’t prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
\q1
\v 7 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem,
\q2 who said, “Raze it!
\q2 Raze it even to its foundation!”
\q1
\v 8 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction,
\q2 he will be happy who repays you,
\q2 as you have done to us.
\q1
\v 9 Happy shall he be,
\q2 who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
