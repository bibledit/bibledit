\v 7 God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph,
\q2 I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
\q1
\v 8 Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine.

\q2 Who has led me to Edom?
\q1
\v 11 Haven’t you rejected us, God?
\q2 You don’t go out, God, with our armies.
\q1
\v 12 Give us help against the enemy,
\q2 for the help of man is vain.
\q1
