\c 12
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean.
\v 3 In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
\v 4 She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.
\v 5 But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.
\p
\v 6 “‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove, for a sin offering.
\v 7 He shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; then she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.
\p “‘This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.
\v 8 If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”
