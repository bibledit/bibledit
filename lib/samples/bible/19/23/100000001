\c 23
\d A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh is my shepherd:
\q2 I shall lack nothing.
\q1
\v 2 He makes me lie down in green pastures.
\q2 He leads me beside still waters.
\q1
\v 3 He restores my soul.
\q2 He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
\q1
\v 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
\q2 I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
\q1 Your rod and your staff,
\q2 they comfort me.
\q1
\v 5 You prepare a table before me
\q2 in the presence of my enemies.
\q1 You anoint my head with oil.
\q2 My cup runs over.
\q1
\v 6 Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life,
\q2 and I will dwell in Yahweh’s house forever.
