\v 1 Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly.
\v 2 He said,
\q1 “I called because of my affliction to Yahweh.
\q2 He answered me.
\q1 Out of the belly of Sheol\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* I cried.

\q2 in the heart of the seas.
\q1 The flood was all around me.
\q2 All your waves and your billows passed over me.
\q1
\v 4 I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight;
\q2 yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’
\q1
\v 5 The waters surrounded me,
\q2 even to the soul.
\q1 The deep was around me.
\q2 The weeds were wrapped around my head.
\q1
\v 6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains.
\q2 The earth barred me in forever:
\q2 yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.

\q2 My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.

\v 8 Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
\q2
\v 9 But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving.
\q2 I will pay that which I have vowed.
\q1 Salvation belongs to Yahweh.”

\v 10 Then Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.
