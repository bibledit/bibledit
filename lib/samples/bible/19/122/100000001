\c 122
\d A Song of Ascents. By David.
\q1
\v 1 I was glad when they said to me,
\q2 “Let’s go to Yahweh’s house!”
\q1
\v 2 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem,
\q2
\v 3 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together,
\q1
\v 4 where the tribes go up, even Yah’s tribes,
\q2 according to an ordinance for Israel,
\q2 to give thanks to Yahweh’s name.
\q1
\v 5 For there are set thrones for judgment,
\q2 the thrones of David’s house.
\q1
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
\q2 Those who love you will prosper.
\q1
\v 7 Peace be within your walls,
\q2 and prosperity within your palaces.
\q1
\v 8 For my brothers’ and companions’ sakes,
\q2 I will now say, “Peace be within you.”
\q1
\v 9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God,
\q2 I will seek your good.
